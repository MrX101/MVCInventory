This is an example project to show my coding skill. 
It is an inventory system coded in the MVC(Model, View, Controller) coding architecture. To ensure that the functionality is not effected by the Graphical User interface and as such any number of future changes to the GUI could be done and the functionality would not be effected.

If you are not familiar with Unity, please focus your attention on the Assets/Scripts folder. Those the scripts I have made.

Also note that this is using the builtin Unity Test framework to allow Unit testing via NUnit. Though the Tests themselves are done in the Unity Editor via GUI.
